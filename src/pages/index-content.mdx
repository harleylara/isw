# 1 Abstract

Brief description of your task and how you went about to solve it.

# 2 Introduction

Based on the literature (survey articles, books, journals, conference proceedings), which you have found explain and discuss how the scientific subject which you have been investigating is embedded in the superior field, e.g. learning by experimentation is sub field of machine learning ... What are neighboring disciplines (inductive learning, one-shot learning, reinforcement learning, etc)? What are the special aspects which are addressed in the subject and how do they distinguish the subject from neighboring subjects/disciplines? What are the typical assumptions made in the research on the subject? What is the methodology used in the field? (one page)

# 3 Description of the subject

Based on the literature (survey articles, books, journals, conference proceedings), which you have found explain and discuss how the scientific subject which you have been investigating is decomposed into different subfields and/or aspects and/or problem areas (e.g. learning by experimentation: cognitive/developmental psychology, epistemology, theory of experimentation, optimal design and evaluation of experiments, etc. Explain for each subfield/aspect/problem area why you think that is is of crucial importance to the subject which you have been investigating. Explain why you think that the set of subfields/aspects/problems which you have identified in fact covers the whole subject. (one page)

# 4 Annotated Bibliography - [insert topic here]
In this section you should establish a subsection for each subfield/aspect/problem area which you have identified in the foregoing Section ("Description of the subject"). In each of the subsection you give a brief overview of the subfield list the annotated bibliography, i.e. all the papers which you found for this subfield, where each entry in this annotated bibliography should consist of the reference itself and a brief summary of the content of the paper. (as many pages as it takes)

# 5 Conclusions
Summarize you view on the state of the art in the field which you have been investigating. (half a page, times roman 11pt, single space)

# 6 References
List of references in IEEE, ACM, APA, etc. format.
Attach an electronic copy of the paper to each reference!!!!!!!!!
